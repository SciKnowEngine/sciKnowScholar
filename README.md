A PDF-enabled digital libary system for interacting with the scientific literature. 

Our Initial starting point of this project is our previous work on the BioScholar Project (https://github.com/BMKEG/bioscholarProject). 

This will be initially instantiated as version 1.1.5 (following the previous versioning) and encapsulated together as a single project (with a dependency to the lapdftext text extraction library).
